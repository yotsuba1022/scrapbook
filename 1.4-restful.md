# RESTful \(Representational state transfer\)

REST\(**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer\)是Dr. Roy Thomas Fielding在2000年於他的[博士論文](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)中提出來的一種互聯網**軟體架構風格**, 目的是**便於不同軟體/程序在網路中互相傳遞訊息**.

目前在三種主流的webservice實作方案中, 由於REST相較於SOAP與XML-RPC更加地簡潔, 越來越多的webservice開始採用RESTful設計與實作.

REST的要點與標準:

前面強調了, REST是設計的一種風格, 不是標準, 其通常會基於使用HTTP, URI, XML以及HTML這些現有廣泛流行的協議與標準.

1. 資源是由URI來指定.
2. 對資源的操作包括獲取、創建、修改和刪除資源，這些操作正好對應HTTP協議提供的GET、POST、PUT和DELETE方法.
3. 通過操作資源的表現形式來操作資源.
4. 資源的表現形式則是XML或者HTML，取決於讀者是機器還是人，是消費web服務的客戶軟體還是web瀏覽器。當然也可以是任何其他的格式.

REST的要求\(為了儘量忠於原意, 這邊我用英文寫\):

1. 客戶端和伺服器結構\(Client-Server\): Concerns should be separated between clients and servers. This enables client and server components to evolve independently and in turn allows the system to scale.
2. 連接協議具有無狀態性\(Stateless\): The communication between client and server should be stateless. The server need not remember the state of the client. Instead, clients must include all of the necessary information in the request so that server can understand and process it.
3. 能夠利用Cache機制增進性能\(Cache\): Responses from the server must be declared as cacheable or noncacheable. This would allow the client or its intermediary components to cache responses and reuse them for later requests. This reduces the load on the server and helps improve the performance.
4. 一致性的操作界面\(Uniform Interface\): All interactions between client, server, and intermediary components are based on the uniformity of their interfaces. This simplifies the overall architecture as components can evolve independently as long as they implement the agreed-on contract. The uniform interface constraint is further broken down into four subconstraints—resource identification, resource representations, self-descriptive messages, and hypermedia as the engine of application state or HATEOAS. We will examine some of these guiding principles in the later sections of this chapter.
5. 層次化的系統\(Layered System\): Multiple hierarchical layers such as gateways, firewalls, and proxies can exist between client and server. Layers can be added, modified, reordered, or removed transparently to improve scalability.
6. 所需代碼 \(Code on demand, optional\): Clients can extend their functionality by downloading and executing code on demand. Examples include JavaScript scripts, Java applets, Silverlight, and so on. This is an optional constraint.

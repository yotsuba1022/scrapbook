# Microservices \(微服務\)

Microservices是由軟體大師Martin Flower所提出的一種系統架構風格\(architectural style\), 他是這樣說的:

_**In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.**_

就是說以組合式的服務來開發整套的應用系統, 而每個微服務都各自為一個單獨的程式, 並透過輕量級的HTTP API作為彼此間溝通的機制, 然後這些微服務可以各自藉由自動化的佈署機制獨立的進行佈署.
